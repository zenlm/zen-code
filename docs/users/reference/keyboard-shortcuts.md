Press twice to confirm.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

| `Ctrl+B`                       | While a foreground shell command is running: promote it to a background task. The child keeps running, the agent's turn unblocks, and the shell appears in `/tasks` + the Background tasks dialog.

On macOS, the terminal must send Option as Meta.                                                                                                                                                                               |

## History scrollback

Active only when `ui.useTerminalBuffer` is enabled (Settings → UI → Virtualized History). In that mode conversation history is rendered inside an in-app viewport instead of the host terminal scrollback, so the keys below replace the terminal's native scroll.

| Shortcut        | Description                                          |
| --------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| `Shift+Up`      | Scroll history up one line.                          |
| `Shift+Down`    | Scroll history down one line.                        |
| `PgUp`          | Scroll history up one page (viewport height).        |
| `PgDn`          | Scroll history down one page (viewport height).      |
| `Ctrl+Home`     | Jump to the top of the conversation.                 |
| `Ctrl+End`      | Jump to the bottom (and re-engage live auto-follow). |
| **Mouse wheel** | Scroll history (3 lines per tick).                   |

When `ui.useTerminalBuffer` is on, the terminal forwards mouse events to qwen-code so the wheel can drive the in-app viewport. As a side effect, **native click-and-drag text selection is consumed by the program** — hold `Shift` (or `Option` on macOS Terminal / iTerm) while dragging to bypass mouse capture and select text the usual way.
