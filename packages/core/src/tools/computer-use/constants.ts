 * This is the QwenLM fork (`@qwen-code/open-computer-use`), not upstream

 * Codex-specific install paths. Source:
 * https://github.com/QwenLM/open-computer-use
 *
 * NOTE: only the npm *package* name is scoped. The CLI binary the
 * package installs is still named `open-computer-use`, and the binary's
 * own error strings (e.g. "Run `open-computer-use doctor`") use that
 * binary name — `permission-detector.ts` matches against those and must

 *
 * To bump:
 *   1. Update this constant to the new version (e.g. '0.2.1').
 *   2. Run `npx tsx scripts/sync-computer-use-schemas.ts` from the
 *      repo root — it reads this constant by default.
 *   3. Verify the regenerated `schemas.ts` diff is what you expect
 *      (parameter types, required fields, descriptions).
 *   4. Manually smoke-test the e2e flow on macOS.
 *
 * Using an exact pin (NOT `^x.y.z` or `@latest`) is deliberate:
 * the fork is 0.x and may ship schema-affecting changes in a patch
 * release. Locking the version means users get the exact schema
 * surface we tested against; a new release can't silently drift our
 * hardcoded schemas out of sync.
