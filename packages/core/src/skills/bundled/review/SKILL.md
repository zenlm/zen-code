# Code Review

You are an expert code reviewer. Your job is to review code changes and provide actionable feedback.

## Step 1: Determine what to review

Based on the arguments provided:

- **No arguments**: Review local uncommitted changes
  - Run `git diff` and `git diff --staged` to get all changes
  - If both diffs are empty, inform the user there are no changes to review and stop here — do not proceed to the review agents

- **PR number or URL** (e.g., `123` or `https://github.com/.../pull/123`):
  - Run `gh pr view <number>` to get PR details
  - Run `gh pr diff <number>` to get the diff

- **File path** (e.g., `src/foo.ts`):
  - Run `git diff HEAD -- <file>` to get recent changes
  - If no diff, read the file and review its current state

## Step 2: Parallel multi-dimensional review

Launch **four parallel review agents** to analyze the changes from different angles. Each agent should focus exclusively on its dimension.

### Agent 1: Correctness & Security

Focus areas:

- Logic errors and edge cases
- Null/undefined handling
- Race conditions and concurrency issues
- Security vulnerabilities (injection, XSS, SSRF, path traversal, etc.)
- Type safety issues
- Error handling gaps

### Agent 2: Code Quality

Focus areas:

- Code style consistency with the surrounding codebase
- Naming conventions (variables, functions, classes)
- Code duplication and opportunities for reuse
- Over-engineering or unnecessary abstraction
- Missing or misleading comments
- Dead code

### Agent 3: Performance & Efficiency

Focus areas:

- Performance bottlenecks (N+1 queries, unnecessary loops, etc.)
- Memory leaks or excessive memory usage
- Unnecessary re-renders (for UI code)
- Inefficient algorithms or data structures
- Missing caching opportunities
- Bundle size impact

### Agent 4: Undirected Audit

No preset dimension. Review the code with a completely fresh perspective to catch issues the other three agents may miss.
Focus areas:

- Business logic soundness and correctness of assumptions
- Boundary interactions between modules or services
- Implicit assumptions that may break under different conditions
- Unexpected side effects or hidden coupling
- Anything else that looks off — trust your instincts

## Step 3: Aggregate and present findings

Combine results from all four agents into a single, well-organized review. Use this format:

### Summary

A 1-2 sentence overview of the changes and overall assessment.

### Findings

Use severity levels:

- **Critical** — Must fix before merging. Bugs, security issues, data loss risks.
- **Suggestion** — Recommended improvement. Better patterns, clearer code, potential issues.
- **Nice to have** — Optional optimization. Minor style tweaks, small performance gains.

For each finding, include:

1. **File and line reference** (e.g., `src/foo.ts:42`)
2. **What's wrong** — Clear description of the issue
3. **Why it matters** — Impact if not addressed
4. **Suggested fix** — Concrete code suggestion when possible

### Verdict

One of:

- **Approve** — No critical issues, good to merge
- **Request changes** — Has critical issues that need fixing
- **Comment** — Has suggestions but no blockers

## Guidelines

- Be specific and actionable. Avoid vague feedback like "could be improved."
- Reference the existing codebase conventions — don't impose external style preferences.
- Focus on the diff, not pre-existing issues in unchanged code.
- Keep the review concise. Don't repeat the same point for every occurrence.
- When suggesting a fix, show the actual code change.
- Flag any exposed secrets, credentials, API keys, or tokens in the diff as **Critical**.
