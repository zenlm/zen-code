/**
 * @fileoverview Shared `TaskBase` envelope and discriminated `TaskState`
 * union covering the three core task kinds (agent, shell, monitor). The
 * three existing per-kind registries (`BackgroundTaskRegistry`,
 * `BackgroundShellRegistry`, `MonitorRegistry`) each hold entries that
 * extend this base; their per-kind state is layered on via intersection.
 *
 * The base envelope is intentionally narrow:
 *   - `id` / `kind` — registry key + discriminator
 *   - `description` — human label for pill/panel/dialog
 *   - `status` / `startTime` / `endTime` — lifecycle
 *   - `outputFile` / `outputOffset` — reserved path for the per-task
 *     primary stream and a byte cursor for incremental reads
 *   - `notified` — terminal-notification idempotency flag
 *   - `abortController` — unified cancellation handle
 *
 * `outputFile` is mandatory but treated as a *reserved path*, not a
 * guaranteed file. Each kind decides whether it materializes the file:
 * agents lazily open their JSONL writer on the first emitted event,
 * shells stream stdout/stderr from spawn time, and monitors today reserve
 * a path but don't attach a writer. A task that never produces output
 * has a path on its state but no file on disk.
