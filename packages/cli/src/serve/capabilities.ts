/**
 * Subset of `ServeFeature` whose advertisement depends on runtime config

 * daemon was started with `--require-auth`). Each entry pairs the
 * feature key with a predicate over `AdvertiseFeatureToggles` — the
 * toggle decision lives next to the feature key, so adding a new
 * conditional tag is **two coordinated changes** instead of four:
 *
 * 1. Register the tag in `SERVE_CAPABILITY_REGISTRY` above with its
 *    `since` protocol version (just like baseline tags).
 * 2. Add an entry to THIS Map mapping the tag to a toggle predicate
 *    (extend `AdvertiseFeatureToggles` first if the predicate needs a
 *    new field to read).
 *
 * The previous `Set` + per-feature `if`-branch shape needed FOUR
 * coordinated changes (registry, set, toggles interface, predicate
 * branch) and silently fail-CLOSED when the branch was missed —
 * fail-CLOSED is good, but invisible to the contributor adding the
 * tag. The Map shape collapses the predicate-decision and the
 * set-membership into one entry, so a future contributor either
 * registers the predicate (advertised when toggle on) or doesn't
 * register the tag in the Map at all (advertised unconditionally
 * like baseline tags) — both are intentional, neither is a silent
 * miss.
 *
 * Reviewed-through-failure: the
 * `every conditional tag advertises when its toggle is on` test in
 * `server.test.ts` iterates this Map's keys, so a future tag added
 * here whose predicate isn't honored by `getAdvertisedServeFeatures`
 * fails the suite — adoption-of-record for the Map shape rather than
 * relying on a hand-maintained invariant.
