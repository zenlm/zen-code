/**
 * Stage 1 HTTP→ACP bridge.
 *
 * Per #3803 §02 (architectural revision) and design §08 (Roadmap, Stage 1):
 *   - **1 daemon = 1 workspace**: every bridge instance is bound to a
 *     single canonical workspace path at construction
 *     (`BridgeOptions.boundWorkspace`). All `spawnOrAttach` calls must
 *     target that workspace; cross-workspace requests throw
 *     `WorkspaceMismatchError`. Multi-workspace deployments use multiple
 *     daemon processes (one per workspace, supervised externally).
 *   - One `qwen --acp` child total; multiple sessions multiplex onto it
 *     via `connection.newSession()` (the agent's native
 *     `sessions: Map<string, Session>` — see `acp-integration/acpAgent.ts:194`).
 *     Sessions share the child's process / OAuth state / `FileReadCache` /
 *     hierarchy-memory parse.
 *   - HTTP request bodies are forwarded as ACP NDJSON over the child's stdin.
 *   - Child stdout NDJSON notifications publish onto each session's
 *     `EventBus`; HTTP SSE subscribers (`GET /session/:id/events`) drain
 *     it. Cross-client fan-out + `Last-Event-ID` reconnect supported.
 *   - Multi-client requests against the same session serialize through this
 *     bridge (FIFO; honors ACP's "one active prompt per session" invariant).
 *     Different sessions on the same channel can prompt concurrently —
 *     the ACP layer demultiplexes by sessionId.
 *
 * Stage 2 replaces the spawn step with an in-process call into core's
 * ACP-equivalent API. The `HttpAcpBridge` interface stays the same so HTTP
 * route handlers don't need to change.

  // exhaustive allowlist can't enumerate user-defined provider keys,
  // so the agent ends up unable to authenticate.
  //
  // Threat-model rationale: the agent already runs as the same UID
  // with shell-tool access — anything in `~/.bashrc`, `~/.npmrc`,
  // `~/.aws/credentials`, etc. is reachable by prompt injection

 * Environment variables stripped from the spawned `qwen --acp` child's

 *
 * Currently just `QWEN_SERVER_TOKEN`: the daemon's own bearer token,
 * which the agent doesn't need (it speaks to the daemon over stdio,
 * not HTTP). Leaving it in the child's env would let prompt injection
 * turn the agent into an authenticated client of its own daemon — an
 * escalation the agent doesn't otherwise have.
 *
 * **WARNING**: this denylist is correct *only because the agent

 * is reachable via `~/.bashrc`/`~/.aws/credentials`/etc. anyway.
 * Any future mode that **removes** shell-tool access (e.g. a
 * sandbox-locked agent variant) MUST switch this back to an
 * allowlist OR significantly expand the denylist to cover common
 * provider/CI/cloud secret prefixes (`OPENAI_*`, `ANTHROPIC_*`,
 * `AWS_*`, `GITHUB_TOKEN`, `CI_*`, `*_API_KEY`, `*_SECRET`, …).
