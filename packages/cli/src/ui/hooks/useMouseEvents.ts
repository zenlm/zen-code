 * Subscribes to SGR mouse events while `isActive` is true.
 *
 * On activation: writes `?1002h ?1006h` to enable button-event tracking and
 * SGR coordinates, then parses mouse sequences delivered through ink's own
 * input pipeline. On cleanup (or when `isActive` flips false): writes
 * `?1006l ?1002l` to restore the terminal.
 *
 * Why not a dedicated `stdin.on('data')` listener: attaching a `data`
 * listener switches stdin into flowing mode, which drains the buffer before
 * ink's `readable` + `stdin.read()` reader (App.js) can consume it — every
 * keystroke routed through `useInput` would be silently starved while mouse
 * mode is active. Instead we hook ink's `useInput`, which already owns the
 * single stdin reader. ink's input parser captures a full SGR sequence
 * (`ESC [ < … M/m`) as one CSI event and hands it to the handler with the
 * leading ESC stripped (use-input strips a leading `\x1b`), so we re-prepend
 * it before parsing. Non-mouse input does not match and is ignored; ink
 * still routes the same input to the app's other `useInput` handlers, so
 * keyboard navigation is unaffected.
 *
 * Note: only SGR mode (`?1006h`, which we enable) is parsed via this path —
 * we call `parseSGRMouseEvent` directly rather than `parseMouseEvent` (which
 * also tries the X11 fallback). X11 is unwanted here: ink's CSI parser
 * mangles a real `ESC [ M` + 3-byte sequence anyway, and a literal X11 prefix
 * arriving via pasted text could otherwise misfire a spurious mouse event.
 * SGR is the encoding modern terminals emit once `?1006h` is set.
 *
 * The handler is stored in a ref so callers don't need to memoize it.
